Run this script with a dirty kernel tree after building the kernel & modules,
and don't mess with the .config.  Otherwise it'll want to rebuild the modules
as well as the Image :-(

You will need:
  * A dirty kernel tree in the directory '../kernel_raspi/linux'
  * initrd-versatile.img, probably as a symlink to your armedslack-current
    tree (it's in armedslack-current/isolinux)
  * 'Extra' packages in $OUTPUT
