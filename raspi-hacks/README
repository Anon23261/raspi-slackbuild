raspi-hacks -- modifications for ArmedSlack on Raspberry Pi

This package will make the following changes to the ArmedSlack
installation on your Raspberry Pi:

* Serial port - /etc/inittab will be modified to replace the 'Local serial
lines' entries s0, s1 and s2.  The Rasberry Pi's UART is /dev/ttyAMA0, not
/dev/ttyS0.  This prevents the error 'INIT: Id "s0" respawning too fast'.

* Clock - the Raspberry Pi has no hardware clock and boots with the
date/time set to 1970-01-01, so /etc/rc.d/rc.local will be modified to
set the correct date/time from the network (using the 'sntp' command).
Also, to provide a pragmatic approximation for the correct date/time
during early boot and if the network is unavailable, /sbin/hwclock will be
replaced by a shellscript which saves the date/time to disk on shutdown
and restores it on startup.  This prevents the error 'Cannot access the
Hardware Clock via any known method'.

* Tuning - /etc/sysctl.conf will be created to tune vm.min_free_kbytes.
This prevents the error 'smsc95xx 1-1.1:1.0: eth0: kevent 2 may have
been dropped'.
